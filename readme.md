Caching Duplicate Finder Project
================================

This simple project grew out of my need to manage an ever growing archive of pictures.  It seemed that I was forever copying pictures off of my camera and onto my desktop.  EVentually the pictures would get moved into an archive.  But never wanting to loose any I would inevitably end up copying multiple copies of the backups.

There are many programs to search out duplicates.  This project is designed to add the following capabilities to a standard duplicate detecting program - 

- Cache hashes of the files.  This is meant to speed up the process.  There is no reason to recalculate thousands of hashes every time.

- Set master directories where nothing is ever deleted.  There may be intentional duplicates in the some directories that should be left alone.

Please feel free to use if helpful or ask question if curious.
